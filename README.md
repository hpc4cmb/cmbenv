# cmbenv

## Introduction

The CMB field uses a variety of software packages.  Many tools are Python based
and can easily be installed with conda or pip.  Others are more challenging to
install from source, which is often required for non-standard environments like
HPC systems.  The goal of this git repo is to make it "easier" to install many
of these packages while getting simpler tools from Python packages when
possible.

In particular, some systems may require building tools from scratch in order to
be compatible with a specialized compiler toolchain.  Other systems that are a
standard Linux flavor and less performance critical may get some tools from the
OS package manager, conda, pip, etc.


## Configuration

If you are installing on a Linux or OS X workstation you may be able to use one of the existing build configurations.  Here is a decision tree to help guide the selection:

    Linux:  Is your system python3 fairly recent (>= 3.6.0)?
        - YES.  Do you want to use Anaconda python for some reason?
            - YES.  Use the linux-conda config.
            - NO.  Use the linux-venv config.
        - NO.  You should use the linux-conda config.
    OS X:  Are you currently using macports or homebrew to get python3?
        - YES.  Do you want to use Fortran packages (libmadam)?
            - YES.  Install GNU compilers with macports or homebrew.
                    Use the osx-venv-gcc config.
            - NO.  Use the osx-venv-clang config.
        - NO.  Do you want to use Fortran packages (libmadam)?
            - YES.  Install GNU compilers with macports or homebrew.
                    Use the osx-conda-gcc config.
            - NO.  Use the osx-conda-clang config.

### Special Notes for OS X

Apple's operating system can be challenging to work with when building larger compiled packages that do not use X Code.  The native compilers do not support some languages and features, and installing external compilers (gcc) require care to ensure that all dependencies are also built with the same compiler.  Here are some recommendations:

  - Whenever you update your OS, also ensure that X Code and the commandline tools have been updated.

  - If using macports or homebrew, wipe and reinstall these when you upgrade your OS to a new major version.

If you have trouble with python or gcc on OS X, try testing the "osx-conda-clang" config.  This should be the most stand-alone solution since it uses only the system clang compiler.  Downsides of this are the lack of fortran support and perhaps other features like OpenMP threading.

### Custom Configurations

Create or edit a file in the "configs" subdirectory that is named whatever you
like.  This file will define compilers, flags, etc. Optionally create files
with the same name and the ".module" and ".sh" suffixes.  These optional files
should contain any modulefile and shell commands needed to set up the
environment prior to building the tools or loading them later.  See existing
files for examples.

To create a config for a docker image, the config file must be prefixed
with "docker-".  You should not have any "*.module" or "*.sh" files for
a docker config.


## Generate the Script

Use the top-level "cmbenv" script to generate an install script or docker file::

    %> ./cmbenv -c <config> -p <prefix> [-v <version] [-m <moduledir>]

For example::

    %> ./cmbenv -c linux-venv -p ${HOME}/cmbenv -v test


## Installation

For normal installs, simply run the install script.  I recommend doing this in a
"build" directory to avoid cluttering the source.  Continuing the previous
example::

    %> mkdir build; cd build
    %> ../install_linux-venv.sh | tee log

This installs the software and modulefile, as well as a module version file
named `.version_$CMBVERSION` in the module install directory.  You can manually
move this into place if and when you want to make that the default version.  It
also creates a simple shell snippet that you can source instead of using
modules.

### Loading the Software

Continuing the example some more, load the above products into your environment
with::

    %> module use ${HOME}/cmbenv/modulefiles
    %> module load cmbenv

OR::

    %> source ${HOME}/cmbenv/cmbenv.sh


## Docker

For docker installs, run docker build from the same directory as the
generated Dockerfile, so that the path to data files can be found.  Making
docker images requires a working docker installation.  You
should familiarize yourself with the docker tool before attempting to use
it here.

It is recommended to tag the container with the hash of the cmbenv git
repository. In the following snippets, I assume that username is the same on
local machine, Github, DockerHub and NERSC. Build it with:

    %> docker build . -t $USER/cmbenv:$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)


### Push the Docker container to Docker Hub

Login to <https://hub.docker.com> with your Github credentials and create
a new repository named `cmbenv`, then push the image you just built to
DockerHub:

    %> docker login
    %> docker push $USER/cmbenv:$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)

### Use the Docker container at NERSC with shifter

See the [NERSC documentation about shifter](http://www.nersc.gov/users/software/using-shifter-and-docker/using-shifter-at-nersc/).

First login to Cori and pull the image from Docker Hub:

    %> shifterimg pull $USER/cmbenv:xxxxxx

This is going to take a few minutes. Then you can test this interactively:

    %> salloc -N 1 -C haswell -p debug \
       --image=docker:YOURUSERNAME/cmbenv:xxxxxx \
       -t 00:30:00
    %> shifter /bin/bash

To use this image in a slurm batch script, just add:

    #SBATCH --image=docker:YOURUSERNAME/cmbenv:xxxxx

In the SLURM header to set the image. Then prepend `shifter` to all running
commands (after `srun` and all its options).  For example, to run a script in the container:

    srun -n 1 -N 1 shifter myscript.py

If you are running any command in the container, make sure to prepend the shifter command.  For example:

    shifter which myscript.py
